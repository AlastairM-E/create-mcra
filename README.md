## **Getting Started**

Currently, this project will only use to create-react-app to create an app and so has **_no features currently_**. 

However, if you have any feature ideas **_make an issue on make the project's GitHub page_**, explain your idea and I will try and implement it.

The project does use the create-react-app syntax, so:

when running the project for NPM:

    npx create-mcra <your-foldername> <--any-template-you-want-if-any>

and when running this project using yarn:

    yarn create mcra <your-foldername> <--any-template-you-want-if-any>

## **feature requests**

If you have any feature request **_make an issue on make the project's GitHub page_** explaining your idea and I will try and implement it.

However, currently I will **not** be able to incorporate any code submission placed.

## **Issues**

If there are any issue send an issue dictating what you did previous, the unexpected behaviour receieved/error message and I will see If can help.
